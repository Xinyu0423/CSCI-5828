## Note for This Class
1. This class mainly teaches how to develop projects as a software engineer in the industry. Generally speaking, if you know Java, then the content of this class is relatively simple.
2. Because some of the content in the quiz folder might offend the professor's teaching, I deleted the content in the quiz folder

5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
